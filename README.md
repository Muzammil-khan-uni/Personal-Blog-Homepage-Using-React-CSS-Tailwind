Design and develop a personal blog homepage that presents blog posts in a visually appealing card layout. The blog allows users to browse, filter, and search posts by category and keyword. It emphasizes UI layout, component-based structure, props & state management, and responsive design using React and Tailwind CSS.

<h2>ðŸ§± Tech Stack</h2>

React â€“ for building UI components and managing state.

Tailwind CSS â€“ for styling with utility-first responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6+) â€“ for interaction logic, filtering, pagination, etc.

React Icons â€“ for consistent and modern iconography.

âœ… A clean, modern homepage layout with a visually appealing blog card interface

âœ… A dynamic category filter that switches between blog post types like Tech, Travel, and Food

âœ… A search functionality to filter posts based on title keywords

âœ… Implemented pagination to limit visible posts per page for better UX

âœ… Designed a vibrant header and footer section to enrich the UI and improve navigation

âœ… Used React Props, State, Conditional Rendering, and a responsive grid layout to build the core functionality
